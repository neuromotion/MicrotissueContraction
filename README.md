Code Created for the Automated Characterization of Macromorphology in 3D Cortical Microtissues

First use the PegMeasurement.m code to find the radius of the agarose pegs as well as the radius of center circle whose edges should touch the inner edges of the pegs. Then use ThesisContraction.m code to measure the tissue area reduction overtime in microtissues. In order for the contraction code to work, you need to already know the radius of the agarose pegs and center circle (in pixels) which you can measure with the PegMeasurement.m code.
